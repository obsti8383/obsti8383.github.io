Code for managing [Okta](https://www.okta.com) IAM environments.

* Powershell Script that fetches all users and writes userLogin and factorType into a CSV: <https://gist.github.com/obsti8383/a5086aac833a14b49b69b7e6afc32811> 
* Helper Script to iterate all users and find out which have the same attribute content (here employeeNumber) and list them. Can be used to find out if there are double entries for attributes that should be unique (but not configured as such in Okta): <https://gist.github.com/obsti8383/8433967a0faeeca41dc214a3baad8ed0>
