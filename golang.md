* Some improvements for [Joseph Spurriers golang-portable-windows tooling](https://github.com/josephspurrier/golang-portable-windows) to create a portable golang development environment: <https://github.com/obsti8383/golang-portable-windows> - already a little bit outdated with regards to software versions - need some love and thereafter a pull request into Josephs Repo.
