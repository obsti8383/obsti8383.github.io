## Portable Golang Development Environment for Windows

You can find some improvements for [Joseph Spurriers golang-portable-windows tooling](https://github.com/josephspurrier/golang-portable-windows) to create a portable golang development environment in my repository here:
* <https://github.com/obsti8383/golang-portable-windows>

Note: _currently a little bit outdated with regards to software versions - needs some "love" and thereafter a pull request into Josephs Repo_

## Useful Frameworks

* Cross Platform UI Toolkit for Go: [Fyne](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne)

## Useful Links

* Want to learn about golang: [golang.org page](https://golang.org/).
